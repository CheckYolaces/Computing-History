<h1 style="background: #0710f9" >History Of Computing</h1>

<h3 style="background: rgba(60, 70, 77, 0.69)">The Abacus</h3>
<p>Computing has been around for a while now and it has been improving ever since. Therefore, let’s begin with the
    earliest known tool for use in computation; the abacus. It was thought to have been invented in Babylon c. 2400 BC.
    Its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles. Abaci, is a more modern design, and are still
    used as calculation tools today. This was the first known calculator and most advanced system of calculation known
    to date. The abacus, also called a Counting Frame/Calculator, is a calculating tool that was in use in Europe,
    China and Russia, centuries before the adoption of the written Hindu–Arabic numeral system and is still used by
    merchants, traders and clerks in some parts of Eastern Europe, Russia, China and Africa. Today, abaci are often
    constructed as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires, but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves
    in sand or on tablets of wood, stone, or metal.</p>

<h3 style="background: rgba(60, 70, 77, 0.69)">The ENIAC</h3>
<p>  Later on newer computing equipment started to be introduced to the world, for example the ENIAC also known as
    Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer was the first electronic general-purpose computer. It was digital,
    and could solve "a large class of numerical problems through reprogramming. Although ENIAC was designed and
    primarily used to calculate artillery firing tables for the United States Army’s Ballistic Research Laboratory,
    its first programs included a study of the feasibility of the thermonuclear was formally dedicated at the University
    of Pennsylvania on February 15, 1946 and was known as a the "Giant Brain" by the press. It had a speed on the order
    of one thousand (103) times faster than that of electro-mechanical machines; this computational power, coupled with
    general-purpose programmability, excited scientists and industrialists alike. This combination of speed and
    programmability allowed for thousands more calculations for problems, as ENIAC calculated at very high speeds at
    the time for example what it took a human 20 hours in 30 seconds.</p>

<h3 style="background: rgba(60, 70, 77, 0.69)">Intel Corperation</h3>
<p>Intel Corporation was founded in 1968 by Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore. Intel improved many computer  by improving
    their speeds tremendously with their processors which helped many companies find information faster than ever before.
    Intel Core is Intel’s brand name for various mid-range to high-end home and business microprocessors. These processors
    displaced the existing mid-to-high end Pentium processors of the time, moving the Pentium to the entry level, and bumping
    the Celeron series of processors to low end. Identical or more capable versions of Core processors are also sold as Xeon
    processors for the server and workstation markets. As of 2016 there are new type of intel processors like the Intel
    Core i7, Intel Core i5, Intel Core i3, Intel Core i7, Intel Core i5 and Intel Core i3 which are still faster than the
    previous models.</p>

<h3 style="background: rgba(60, 70, 77, 0.69)">Microsoft</h3>
<p>Later on software developers started to be announced such as Microsoft, one of the most famous today, emerged. Microsoft
    is a multinational computer technology corporation. The history of Microsoft began on April 4, 1975, when it was founded
    by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in Albuquerque. Its current best-selling products are the Microsoft Windows operating system,
    Microsoft Office suite of productivity software, Xbox a line of entertainment of games, music and video and Bing, a line
    of search engines.</p>

<h1 style="background: #f90011">Conclusion</h1>
<p>There are thousand pieces of computing history, these are just a few parts of it. Many of the older inventions leading
    to computing are still being improved to this date. For example the abacus helped find calculations and now a smaller
    device which is called a calculator which does the same thing as the abacus but much faster and has more options.
    Computing will improve as time goes by and as our technology improves, and will be known for decades.</p>
